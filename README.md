# word-ML-engine

This is an word engine that will reconstruct words and phrases from letters with the help of ML. It essentialy will autocomplete words with missing letters

**This is still in development. latest commit will likely be unstable**

# How it will work
- It will have a word bank or stored words (i will likely source this from a third party)
- an algorthm will use the letters in the word and their order to generate a list of possible words that the incomplete word could be

# Why I made (or am making) this
- At school, I couldn't see some letters of some words from far so I though that this would be helpful for situations like that
